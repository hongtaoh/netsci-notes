# Graph Theory and Some Basic Concepts{#Graph}

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
The following is not originally from me, but my notes from reading [*Network Science*](http://networksciencebook.com/) (Ch. 2.1-2.3) by [Albert-László Barabási](https://barabasi.com/). Notes are accompanied by my explanations. 
```

What is a network composed of? How is a network different from another one? In this chapter, we are going to study some very basic concepts of network science: size of a network, number of links, degree, average degree, degree distribution, and adjacency matrix. 

## Königsberg bridge problem (Ch. 2.1)

The above image is from [*beanz Magazine*](https://www.kidscodecs.com/7-bridges-konigsberg/).

The challenge: Are you able to wall across all the seven bridges but cross each bridge only once? The starting and ending point is not specified. 

Before reading on, I highly recommend you to try [this exercise ](https://www.mathsisfun.com/activity/seven-bridges-konigsberg.html) on [mathsisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/) by yourself. Getting the answer from others won't help you learn it at the deepest level. 

---

**Solution** to this challenge: if a path exists which allows a person to cross all the bridges but walk across each bridge only once, which is called a "**Euler Path**", the number of nodes having an odd number of bridges should be either zero or two. When there are two nodes having an odd number of bridges, i.e., having an odd degree (a point we'll learn later), one of the two nodes should be the starting point and the other the end point. 

This remarkable discovery by Euler led to the development of a new branch in mathematics: [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).

## Networks and graphs (Ch. 2.2)

The components in a network are called **nodes** or **vertices** and the direct connections between them are called **links** or **edges**. When we are describing a network in real life, it's better to use **networks**, **nodes**, and **links**, whereas **graphs**, **vertices**, and **edges** are mostly used for an abstract representation of networks. Some people do not care about these distinctions, though.

***N***, meaning the **number of nodes**, is also called the **size of the network**. Nodes are labeled as ***i*** = 1,2,3,..., *N*

***L***, representing the **total number of links** in a network. 

For an individual link, we may represent it as $(i, j)$. For example, (2,4) denotes the link connecting nodes 2 and 4. 

Links can either be **directed** or **undirected**. If I make a phone call to you, then the link between us is from me to you. It is **directed**. If we are friends on social media, then this link is **undirected**. 

A network is **directed** if all of its links are **directed**. If all of its links are **undirected**, then this network is an **undirected** network. 

## Degree, average degree, and degree distribution (Ch. 2.3)

### Degree
The **degree** of a node is simply the number of links connecting it to other nodes. 

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide', error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("igraph")
```

```{r nunit2-nodes, fig.asp=.7, fig.width=6, fig.cap='An undirected network for illustration.', fig.align='center', out.width='90%', echo=TRUE}
library(igraph)
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
g1 <- graph( edges=c(1,2, 1,3, 2,3, 3,4), n=4, directed=FALSE)
plot(g1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv(condaenv = "r-reticulate", conda="/Users/Tal/Library/r-miniconda")
```

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```{python echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_node(1)
G.add_node(2)
G.add_node(3)
G.add_node(4)
G.add_edge(1,2)
G.add_edge(2,3)
G.add_edge(1,3)
G.add_edge(3,4)
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, font_weight="bold")
plt.show()
```

For example, in the above network, nodes 1, 2, and 4 have a degree of two. Node 3 has a degree of three. 

For the $i^{th}$ node in a network, we'll denote its degree as $k_i$. Therefore, for the above network, $k_1$=$k_2$=$k_4$=2, $k_3$=3. 

As mentioned above, the **total number of links** is denoted as ***L***. In an undirected network, it is easy to understand that ***L*** should be half of the sum of all the node degrees. It should be halved because each link belongs to two nodes and therefore each is counted twice. We have:

\begin{equation} 
  L = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N k_i (\#eq:TotalLink)
\end{equation} 

In the above network, $L = 4$.

### Average degree

**Average degree**, denoted as $\langle k \rangle$ is simply the mean of all the node degrees in a network. For the network above (Figure \@ref(fig:nunit2-nodes)), $\langle k \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot (k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot (2+2+3+1) = 2$. This means that on average, each node in the network has 2.25 links. 

According to its definition, we know that $\langle k \rangle$ = $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N k_i$. Combined with Eq. \@ref(eq:TotalLink), we have:

\begin{equation} 
  \langle k \rangle = \frac{2L}{N} (\#eq:AverageDegree)
\end{equation} 

How can we understand this equation? 

I would understand it this way: we are calculating the **average** degree, so the denominator will be ***N***, i.e., number of nodes, and the nominator will be the sum of all the nodes' number of links, which should be $2L$ because each link is shared by two nodes. 

The above equation Eq. \@ref(eq:AverageDegree) is for undirected networks. What about directed networks? Should we calculate their average degree the same way?

```{r nunit2-nodes-directed, fig.asp=.7, fig.width=6, fig.cap='A directed network for illustration.', fig.align='center', out.width='90%', echo=TRUE}
g2 <- graph( edges=c(1,2, 1,3, 2,3, 3,4), n=4, directed=TRUE)
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
plot(g2)
```

Each link in the above network (\@ref(fig:nunit2-nodes-directed)) is directed. If we calculate the network's average degree according to Eq. \@ref(eq:AverageDegree), we will be losing information. 

Therefore, we will distinguish between **incoming degree**, denoted as $k_i^{in}$ and **outgoing degree**, denoted as $k_i^{out}$. $k_i^{in}$ means the number of links from other nodes pointing to node $i$, and $k_i^{out}$ means the number of links starting from node $i$ and pointing to other nodes. 

For a given node $i$ in a directed network, its degree is the sum of incoming degree and outgoing degree. Therefore,

\begin{equation} 
  k_i = k_i^{in} + k_i^{out} (\#eq:degree-directed)
\end{equation} 

And ***L***, the total number of links in a directed network, is:

\begin{equation}
  L = \sum_{i=1}^N k_i^{in} = \sum_{i=1}^N k_i^{out} (\#eq:total-links-directed)
\end{equation}

For a directed link between node *i* and node *j*, i.e., (*i*, *j*), it constitutes an **incoming degree** for one node, but an **outgoing degree** for the other. For example, in the network (\@ref(fig:nunit2-nodes-directed)), (1,2) counts as an **incoming degree** for node 2, but an **outgoing degree** for node 1. 

In fact, if we combine Eq. \@ref(eq:degree-directed) with Eq. \@ref(eq:total-links-directed), we will know that Eq. \@ref(eq:total-links-directed) is equal to Eq. \@ref(eq:TotalLink). Then why can't we stick to Eq. \@ref(eq:TotalLink) even for a directed network? This is because, I guess, we can have more information, i.e., incoming or outgoing degree, by using Eq. \@ref(eq:total-links-directed).

Last, what's the average degree for a directed network?

We can definitely use Eq. \@ref(eq:AverageDegree), but, again, we will be missing valuable information. Therefore, we will distinguish between $\langle k_{in} \rangle$ and $\langle k_{out} \rangle$, the two of which, in fact, are equal:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \langle k_{in} \rangle & = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N k_i^{in}\\
  & = \langle k_{out} \rangle\\
  & = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N k_i^{out}\\
  & = \frac{L}{N} 
\end{split}
(\#eq:average-degree-directed)
\end{equation}

### Degree distribution

In a large network, nodes' degrees vary. For example, there might be 100 nodes with a degree of 10, 50 nodes with a degree of 9, 30 nodes with a degree of 7, etc.. Then what is the probability that a randomly picked node will have a degree of $k$? 

Let's denote this probability as $p_k$, and call it as **degree distribution**, which, as is described above, is defined as "the probability that a randomly picked node in a network has a degree of $k$". According to this definition, we know that:

\begin{equation}
  p_k = \frac{N_k}{N} (\#eq:degree-distribution)
\end{equation}

where $N_k$ represents the number nodes that have a degree of $k$. From the equation above, we can infer that $N_k = Np_k$

We also know that since $p_k$ is a probability, it should add up to 1:

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^\infty p_k = 1 (\#eq:pk-sum)
\end{equation}

Take the network in Figure \@ref(fig:nunit2-nodes) as an example, its degree distribution is as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide', error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
deg.dist <- degree_distribution(g1, cumulative = FALSE, mode="all")
deg <- degree(g1)
t <- table(deg) 
sum (t) # This will be the total count (1+2+1)
t/sum(t) # this will also be a table; the value did not change but the count will be it's original count denominated by the total count, which will be the frequency
# The above inspiration came from https://www.sci.unich.it/~francesc/teaching/network/distribution.html
barplot(t/sum(t), xlab="k", ylab="Frequencies", main="Degree distribution", col="orange")
```

## Adjacency matrix
The adjacency matrix of a network that has $N$ nodes has $N$ rows and $N$ columns. If there is a link from node $i$ to node $j$, then $A_ij = 1$. If node $i$ and node $j$ are not connected, then  $A_ij = 0$. 

For an undirected network, the link $(i, j)$ has two representations: $A_ij$ = $A_ji$. That's why the adjacency matrix of an undirected network is always symmetric. 

Lets have a look at the adjacency matrix of `g1` and `g2`. 

For `g1`:

```{r}
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
plot(g1)
```

```{r}
as_adjacency_matrix(g1)
```

For `g2`:

```{r}
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
plot(g2)
```

```{r}
as_adjacency_matrix(g2)
```

Each dot in the matrix means $0$. The adjacency matrices here did not label the column name. To better understand it, you can imagine that the columns are also labeled as [1, ], [2, ], [3, ] and [4, ] as the rows are. 

## Chapter 2 Homework
```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
This part is based on Professor YY's module 2 assignment of [measuring the friendship paradox](https://github.com/yy/netsci-course/blob/master/m02-whynetworks/friendship_paradox.ipynb).
```

You can find the homework [here](https://github.com/yy/netsci-course/blob/master/m02-whynetworks/friendship_paradox.ipynb).

The following task prompts are based on the above homework. You can use them to keep practicing coding in Python. 

### Task 2-1: `Networkx` Basics
- 2-1-1. Import `networkx` as `nx`.

- 2-1-2. Set both random seed and numpy random seed to be `42`.

- 2-1-3. Create a networkx graph named `my_first_graph` which contains three nodes and 2 edges, i.e., (1,2) and (2,3).

- 2-1-4. In the codes you used for Task `2-3`: Which element is a `class`? Which is an `object`? Which is a `method`?

- 2-1-5. Print the number of nodes in `my_first_graph`. *Hint* : `len()`

- 2-1-6. Print the degree of Node 2, in the format of "Node 2's degree: m".

- 2-1-7. Print Node 2's neighbors, in the format of "Node 2's neighbors: [m, n, p, q]". *Hint* : `neighbor()` or `neighbors()`?

  - Note: When you directly return Node 2's neighbors, the result will be `dict_keyiterator at 0x10ec84860`, which is an [iterator object](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_iterators.asp). Try to solve this problem either by a for loop or through a [list comprehension](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Comprehensions.html)

- 2-1-8. Print all the node's neighbors in `my_first_graph` in the form of "Node 1's neighbors: [m, n, p, q]" using a python for loop. 

  - *Hint* : The for loop will iterate over the list returned by the `nodes()` function. 

- 2-1-9. Print all the edges in `my_first_graph`. 

- 2-1-10. Plot `my_first_graph`. *Hint* : `.draw()`

### Task 2-2: Friendship paradox example

- 2-2-1. Create a star graph with 20 nodes, and plot it. 

- 2-2-2. Calculate the average degree of the star graph you just created. Use a for loop to calculate the total degrees. 

  - *Hint* : You might find the operator of `+=` useful for `2-2-2`. `a += b` is short for `a = a + b`.

- 2-2-3. Do the same thing using [numpy's mean function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html) which takes in a list and returns the mean of this list. 

```{block2, type='rmdreminder'}
I do not understand Professor YY's note here: "so if you print a numpy float it will display differently than if you printed a python float, which is why we get the intentional truncation of the value when displayed". 
```

- 2-2-4. Get `star_graph`'s average degree using networkx's `info()` function. 

### Task 2-3: Generating random and scale-free networks

- 2-3-1. Generate a random network with 20 nodes and a connection probability of 0.3. *Hint* : [`erdos_renyi_graph`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.erdos_renyi_graph.html).

- 2-3-2. Generate a scale-free network with 20 nodes with each new node having three edges to attach to existing nodes. *Hint* : [`barabasi_albert_graph()`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph.html)
